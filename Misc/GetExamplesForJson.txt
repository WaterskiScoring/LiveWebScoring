I can look at breaking out the components of the EventScoreDesc but that maybe difficult in SQL

I can look into providing options for excluding certain fields but that also is a bit of challenge but not impossible.  You don't have any control regarding filtering which fields you use and which are excluded?

I can also look at an optional control on number of returned rows

Returning the skier's rank is not really possible.  WSTIMS and the Live Web doesn't really have  the concept of a rank.  Each skier has a Ranking Average which is used to sort the running order but there is no concept of a rank per se.  I have can include the ranking average.  We frequently view a skier's score as compared to their ranking average to see how well they did relative to their expectations.  I understand at the high end that is not as useful but for the vast majority of our tournaments it is extremely useful information.

I believe you can return team results.  If you check the information I sent with the URL I think you will see that there is a team option for skiEvent.  Although I'm not entirely sure if  that works for collegiate.  I will look into that.
